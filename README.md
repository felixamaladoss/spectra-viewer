Both are arrays.  Peaks should have two data points: -  intensity, mz
Data should have single data point.

For example: 
```
"peaks": [
    {
      "intensity": 2.320237,
      "mz": 51.819397
    },
    {
      "intensity": 2.952204,
      "mz": 57.748032
    } ]
	
"data‚Äù: [-11066.0, -10363.0, -8636.0]
